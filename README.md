## KNOW HOW :

###  How to override built in view scripts ?

* In your module, under the view directory, create the folder tree crunchy-signup/register.
* Create the necessary override view scripts, depending on which page(s) you want to change:
e.g.: crunchy-signup/register/register.phtml
* Refer to each built-in view script to see how the form is configured and rendered.
NOTE: Your module must be loaded after CrunchySignup or the overriding will not work.
